# COVID-19 Vaccination Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes the efficiency of COVID-19 vaccinations using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Currently, we use Ridge Regression to predict vaccination efficiency based on population metrics and health measures. In the second sprint of the project, we plan to ensemble Polynomial Regression, LSTM, and Random Forest models to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors impacting vaccination efficiency.

## Introduction
This project aims to evaluate the efficiency of COVID-19 vaccinations through various machine learning models. By ensembling Polynomial Regression, LSTM, and Random Forest models, we seek to identify key factors influencing vaccination efficiency and leverage machine learning's predictive capabilities.

## Data Collection
Data for this study is sourced from publicly available COVID-19 datasets, including:
- Vaccination rates
- Population demographics
- Health metrics

For more information, please visit the [WHO COVID-19 Data Dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data).

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Cleaning and filtering data
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing and scaling features
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Models Used
### Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes L2 regularization. It is used to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, making it suitable for predicting vaccination efficiency.

### Polynomial Regression (Planned for Second Sprint)
A regression analysis method that models the relationship between the dependent and independent variables as an nth degree polynomial.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Planned for Second Sprint)
A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, particularly useful for sequential data.

### Random Forest (Planned for Second Sprint)
An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

## Results
The results section will include a comparative analysis of the models based on performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings of the study, including which model performed best and insights gained regarding factors affecting vaccination efficiency.

## Future Work
Future work includes:
- Exploring additional machine learning models
- Incorporating more diverse datasets
- Enhancing model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
